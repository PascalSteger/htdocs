	<li>
	  Describe the properties of a 2-element adding radio interferometer!
	</li>
	<li>
	  Where was the Sun during the second week in 2008? Where were
	  A Cassiopeiae and A Cygni? Split the time between sunrise and
	  sunset in three parts and determine the positions right in the
	  middle of the corresponding interval.
    </li>
	<li>
	  Simulate the earth-moon system using assembler.
	</li>
	<li>
	  Write a program to simulate a classical three-body problem
	  using a leap-frog algorithm.
    </li>
	<li>
	  Run a Gadget-2 simulation on a Phenom9750 / SuSE
	  environment. You might install MPICH, gsl, fftw(-mpi)
	  beforehands.
    </li>
	<li>
	  Visualize it!
	</li>
	<li>
	  Analyze a Gadget-2 snapshot file of a cosmological
	  simulation and search for correlations between angular momenta
	  , inertia axes and mass or position vector for both gas and
	  dark matter particles.
    </li>

	<li>
	  Both questions 1 and 2 can be answered from a
      <a href="proposal_Diavolezza_2008.pdf">
        proposal
      </a>
      for the <i>Astroweek 2008</i> in Diavolezza, Switzerland.

	<li>
	  For x86-processors you can look at a
      <a href="Earth_Moon_RosAsm.exe.tar.gz">
        RosAsm program
      </a>.

      Open the PE using RosAsm itself. For processors other than x86
      you may need to rewrite it.</li>

	  TBD

	  This task should present no special complications, as long as
	  you own an smp-processor and have a working internet
	  access. Follow the instructions from <b>gsl</b>, <b>fftw</b>, <b>hdf5</b>,
      <b>mpich</b> and <b>gadget2</b>.
	</li>
	<li>
	  There are specialized programs for visualizations of several
	  simulation formats, as e.g. splotch for GADGET2. For RAMSES,
	  have a look at the projected density of
      <a href="../mov_ov_dm.avi">
        dark matter
      </a>
      and
      <a href="../mov_ov_gas.avi">
        gas
      </a>
      of a simulation from z=100 to z=10.
