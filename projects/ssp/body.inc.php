	  How do the Brioullin-zones look like for a two-dimensional,
	  rectangular array?

	<li>
	  Describe the magnetic properties of MnS. You may use an

	<li>
	  Describe two models for Quantum Computation.

      and write down what is sent, either by hand or directly into
	  your keyboard. In reality the text would probably be sent with
	  little higher speed. And with some random spaces between
	  characters and words.
